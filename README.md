# Worth Mensionning
I'm aware you were expecting a react project not an react native one, but knowing how easy it is to deploy an app thanks to expo, I though it would be a nice touch to see your app running on a real device, it a react native position after all ! :)

Due to the time limitation, I took the liberty to re-use one of my own project as a base so we have:
- basic unitary tests supported by Jest
- linting: I'm using my own rules here, but I'm confortable using other ones.
- duckerise reducers: I'm used to this approach, but once again, I'm conforatble as well with the more classic way to split reducers/selector/action/action creator
- some balel alias to help the imports of in-house files
- [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com) who are for me a very elegemt way to deal with styling, with it you can have a proper separation of concern when it is about the styling !, it help having a very simple to read render function !
